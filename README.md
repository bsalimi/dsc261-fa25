# DSC 261: Responsible Data Science 



## Description:

This course explores the foundations of **Responsible Data Science**, emphasizing rigorous methodology and ethical application. Students begin with **Causal Inference**, moving beyond correlation to uncover true causal relationships, and continue with **Algorithmic Fairness**, learning to detect and mitigate bias for equitable outcomes. The course also highlights **Data Valuation**, teaching how to measure and attribute the impact of datasets on model performance, alongside **Debugging and Data Selection**, where students develop practical skills for identifying data issues, refining inputs, and ensuring robustness. By integrating theory with applied techniques, the course prepares students to design, evaluate, and deploy data science methods that are both technically sound and socially responsible.

### Course Workload

In this course, students will engage in a project-based and presentation learning experience, emphasizing teamwork, practical application of data science techniques, and effective communication. Groups of 5-6 students will collaborate to present papers and develop projects on topics relevant to the class.  

**Team formation**: Team formation details will be announced on Canvas. 

This course will involve paper presentations and projects. The grading break up is as follows: Paper Presentations (30%), Project Proposal(5%), Midterm Update (5%), Project Report (30%), Project Presentation (20%), Class Participation (10%).

#### Paper Presentation (Mid-Quarter)
Each team will present 2 related papers in one domain. The presentation will be **15 minutes**, followed by a **5-minute discussion**. Teams will sign up for the presentation topics [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PsbWYe7Vi7m3fyBHGGzsRIctUAR7zivzQTLJONyb10A/edit?usp=sharing)

Grading for the paper presentation is split as follows:
- Depth of Analysis (12%) – Understanding, critique, and synthesis of the papers.
- Clarity & Organization (9%) – Clear structure, effective visuals, and presentation.
- Discussion Engagement (6%) – Thoughtful questions and interaction with the audience.
- Team Collaboration (3%) – Equal contribution from all members.

#### Projects:
**Guidelines for Project**
Each project must
- Present a clearly defined hypothesis and contribute in at least one of the following areas:
   - Propose a novel theory or algorithm.
   - Apply an existing approach to a new domain.
   - Reimplement a paper (published at top ML venues like NeurIPS/ICLR/ICML) where no public code is available.
   - A comprehensive tutorial on one of the topics listed in the [presentation sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PsbWYe7Vi7m3fyBHGGzsRIctUAR7zivzQTLJONyb10A/edit?usp=sharing). The tutorial must have some empirical results and analysis.

- Experiments should be rigorously designed, with well-defined, measurable metrics. All results must include error bars.
- For theory-focused projects, formal proofs are required.
- Please use this [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/sample-acm-ccs/hqrzvbjgvfvz) for project reports.

**Note on Project grading**
Projects will be graded on contribution, effort, writing, and execution. Projects with thoughtfully designed experiments and solid execution will **not be penalized for yielding negative results**.

**Project Timeline**
The course will have three project checkpoints:
1. Initial Proposal: Due October 12 11:59 PM PST
2. Midterm Update: Due November 2 11:59 PST
3. Final Report: Date to be announced

Students are encouraged to meet with the instructor team regularly for guidance. The project will culminate in a short in-class presentation, where students will also create visual posters and dynamic presentations.
